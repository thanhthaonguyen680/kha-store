```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORE_NAME=
```

### 3. Set up the database

In the Supabase SQL Editor, run `supabase/schema.sql`. It's the single, up-to-date source of truth — tables, RLS policies, storage buckets, and seed data all in one file.

> The other `supabase/migration_*.sql` files are historical, incremental changes already folded into `schema.sql`. They only matter if you're upgrading a database that was set up before a given feature existed — a fresh project never needs them.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server prints the local URL to use (default `http://localhost:3000`, or another port if that one is busy).

## Contributing Workflow

This repo is public at [github.com/thanhthaonguyen680/kha-store](https://github.com/thanhthaonguyen680/kha-store).

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thanhthaonguyen680/kha-store.git
   cd kha-store
   ```
2. **Create a branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Commit & push:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub for review before merging into `main`.
5. Once merged, Vercel automatically deploys `main` to [khaoffical.vn](https://khaoffical.vn/).

## Deployment

The project auto-deploys via [Vercel](https://vercel.com) on every push to `main`. Any new `supabase/migration_*.sql` file must be run manually in the Supabase SQL Editor after deploying — migrations are not applied automatically. Each new migration should also be folded into `supabase/schema.sql` so it stays a complete, accurate schema for anyone setting up a fresh project.

**Analytics:** the app ships with `@vercel/analytics` already wired into `app/layout.tsx`. After deploying, go to the project on Vercel → **Analytics** tab → **Enable** to start seeing visitor/pageview data. No extra env vars or code changes needed.
